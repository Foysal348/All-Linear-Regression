# All Linear Regression

This repository contains implementations of linear regression in Python, accompanied by practical, step-by-step examples.  
The primary focus is on **simple linear regression**, model evaluation, and **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** statistical analysis using real-world data.

## Project Overview

Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in Machine Learning and Statistics.  
This project demonstrates:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training using `scikit-learn`
- Statistical evaluation (R², RMSE)
- Residual analysis
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using `statsmodels`
- Visualisation of regression line and residuals

**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Analysis**

The notebook also applies OLS regression using statsmodels to provide:

Statistical significance (p-values)

Confidence intervals

F-statistics

Residual diagnostics


This gives a complete statistical interpretation beyond basic machine learning metrics.

**Visualization**

The project includes multiple plots:
